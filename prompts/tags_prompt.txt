I have a series of YouTube videos created for the YouTube Shorts platform. They each contain one complete sentence, where the latter half of the sentence is shown in the latter half of the video (for the purpose of retention). For example, the former half may be (Nobody apologizes for how they treated me...) and the latter half may be (They just blamed me for how I reacted). They are not all of the same subject matter, but all follow the same formula. The target audience for the videos are Grades 6 - 8. Please write 50 relevant YouTube tags, relevant to the style of content. Please consider the target audience and optimise for the YouTube algorithm. You must format the tags to be separated with a comma in a large paragraph, please write 50 tags. Ensure the tags do not start with a hashtag.
