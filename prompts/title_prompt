I have a series of YouTube videos created for the YouTube Shorts platform. They each contain one complete sentence, where the latter half of the sentence is shown in the latter half of the video (for the purpose of retention). For example, the former half may be (Nobody apologizes for how they treated me...) and the latter half may be (They just blamed me for how I reacted). They are not all of the same subject matter, but all follow the same formula. The target audience for the videos are Grades 6 - 8. Please write 25 YouTube titles, relevant to the style of content. Please consider the target audience and use emojis. The title should be 60-70 characters long, and contain 3 hashtags (the total character length of the hashtags cannot be larger than that of the actual title). Please ensure that one of the hashtags is '#shorts'. An example title may be 'üï∞Ô∏è Time doesn't heal everything... #HealingJourney #TimeDoesntHeal #Shorts'.
